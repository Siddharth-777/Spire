Array:

1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]



2. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.



3. Contains Duplicate
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Explanation:
The element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation:
All elements are distinct.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true



44. Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters
Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example:
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "ece" has only two distinct characters: 'e' and 'c'.


41. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Linked List
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example:
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The linked list contains duplicate nodes with value 1. After deleting the duplicate nodes, the linked list becomes 1->2.


35. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Given a sorted array of integers nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

Example:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).


27. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

Example:
Input: nums1 = [1, 3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.


20. Merge K Sorted Lists
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Example:
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are: [ 1->4->5, 1->3->4, 2->6 ] merging them into one sorted list: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
